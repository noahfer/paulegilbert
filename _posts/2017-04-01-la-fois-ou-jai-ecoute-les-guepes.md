After making the paper sphere inspired by the queen-wasp's hibernation cell, I decided to build one made out of felted wool, a flexible, protective and body temperature regulating material, better suited to my human condition. I used it in performance as I returned to my micro-site on the Lachine Canal where the surroundings became my creative interlocutor and collaborator. To conclude the cycle of this project, I made a rubbing drawing of the site of observation; referring to the tradition of rubbing gravestones.
