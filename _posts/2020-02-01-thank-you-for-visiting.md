During the spring of 2020, Montreal was paused due to the pandemic. It exhibited an unusual silence imbued with  uncertainty. On May 17th, the blooming pear tree in my backyard became my studio for a day as it was visited by a very large number of busy guests. It is your turn to be invited andâ€¦ thank you for visiting!
