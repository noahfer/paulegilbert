The concept of corporeity in relation to space and time is central to my research, along with the notion of trace produced by the friction between different surfaces and materials, including the human body. My strategies often value the process, structure and materiality and crisscross the live action and the archival. 
In this performance realized in April 2019, I was seeking to navigate within the liminal space between balance and vulnerability through a series of improvised and sincere gestures, accomplishing abstract tasks, in dialogue with geometric shapes and surfaces made out of diverse materials. These could simultaneously and alternatively play the roles of support, obstacle and recorders of action. The frontier between the marking substrate and what was being marked was being blurred. The compound angles of the volumes alluded to a desire of challenging, confronting and appropriating the concept of the grid which ciphers for western ideas of reason and order.
