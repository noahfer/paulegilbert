My artistic investigation focuses on the body: my female body of mature age and the body’s spatiotemporality, both literally and philosophically speaking. I also examine the notions of trace, focusing on the reciprocal relationship between marking and being marked.  As I had started materializing the liminal space between touching bodies, the pandemic crisis became an eerily condensed context for my research and has deflected it toward the concept of physical distancing. Trough the Contact Series, I am developing haptic, low-tech and tangible means of being linked to one another without physical contact—an embodied way of being in touch without touching. This research applies to human and non-human bodies, alive and inert, real and imagined.
