“Openscore” is a collaborative performance work exploring the notion of individual space  with an awareness of the others adapted to home confinement. The project originates from a proposal by the Toronto artist lo bil in the frame of the event “Embodied Interventions” at LeParc, the Performing Arts Research Cluster of the Milieux Institute at Concordia University. The online residency included a total of ten research sessions which were experienced weekly from May to July 2020.
