My creative process resonates with Kathleen Stewart’s (1) description of the word worldling: “an impassive attunement to the ways in which an assemblage of elements comes to hang together; (…) worldlings as perceptual scenes, where scenes becoming worlds are singularities of rhythm and attachment.”
