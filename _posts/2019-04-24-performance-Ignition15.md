This performance was presented in April 2019 at the Leonard & Bina Ellen Gallery in Montreal, during the exhibition Ignition 15, curated by Nicole Burisch and Michèle Thériault. Through a series of improvised and sincere gestures, I was navigating within the liminal space between balance and vulnerability, alluding to diverse issues such as labour, repetition, marking and being marked, etc. These movements were conducted in dialogue with geometric shapes which could simultaneously and alternatively play the roles of support, obstacle and recorders of action. The compound angles of one of the volumes alluded to a desire of challenging, confronting and appropriating the concept of the grid which ciphers for western ideas of reason and order.
