"Secrets de famille, by Paule Gilbert, creates physical embodiments of imagined nostalgia and chance encounters. The appearance of household items are modelled after the artist's personal family memories, while the paper used to make them comes from a bag of shredded paper found on the street, filled with a stranger's undecipherable handwriting (...) The repurposed letters give the viewer an imagined, though unseeable, voyeurism into the personal experience of an unknowable stranger."
